# Cryptography Cheatsheet

## RSA stuff

### Algorithm

* choose primes $p, q$
* $n = pq$
* $\lambda(n) = lcm(\lambda(p), \lambda(q))$
  * $\lambda(p) = \varphi(p) = p-1$ when $p$ is prime
  * $\lambda(n) = lcm(p-1, q-1)$
  * $lcm(a, b) = \frac{|ab|}{gcd(a, b)}$
* choose $e$ coprime to $\lambda(n)$, e.g. 65537
* $d \equiv e^{-1}\ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$
* public key: $e, n$
* private key: $d$
#### encryption

$c \equiv m^e\ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$

#### decryption
$m \equiv c^d\ (\textrm{mod}\ n)$

    return a

# lcm for more than 2 values

## Diffie-Hellman stuff

### Discrete Logarithm problem
$b^k = a$ is hard to solve for $k$

#### Baby-step Giant-step algorithm

#### Pohlig-Hellman algorithm

## Math stuff

### Groups

Definition (lifted verbatim from Wikipedia):

A group is a set ${\displaystyle G}$ together with a binary operation on ${\displaystyle G}$, here denoted
"$\cdot$", that combines any two elements ${\displaystyle a}$ and ${\displaystyle b}$ to form an element
of ${\displaystyle G}$, denoted ${\displaystyle a\cdot b}$, such that the following three requirements, known as group axioms,
are satisfied:

* Associativity
* Identity element
* Inverse element


#### Finite Groups

Definition: Group whose underlying set is finite.

|Term / Whatever|Definition|
|-|-|
|Order|The order of a finite Group G is the number of elements in the underlying set|
|Prime Power|Positive integer power of a single prime power|
|Cyclic Group|Groups that can be generated by a single element (e.g. the groups under modular addition|

### Abstract Algebra

#### Group

Definition:

A group is a set $\displaystyle G$ together with a binary operation on $\displaystyle G$, here denoted "$\displaystyle \cdot $", that combines any two elements $\displaystyle a$ and $\displaystyle b$ to form an element of $\displaystyle G$, denoted $\displaystyle a\cdot b$, such that the following three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied:

__Associativity:__

$\forall a,b,c \in G: (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) $

__Existence of Identity Element:__

$\exists e \in G \\; \forall a \in G: e \cdot a = a$

__Existence of Inverse Element:__

$\exists i \in G \\; \forall a \in G: a \cdot i = e$
