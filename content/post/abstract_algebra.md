# Abstract Algebra Cheatsheet

## Group

A group is a set $\displaystyle G$ together with a binary operation on $\displaystyle G$, here denoted "$\displaystyle \cdot $", that combines any two elements $\displaystyle a$ and $\displaystyle b$ to form an element of $\displaystyle G$, denoted $\displaystyle a\cdot b$, such that the following three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied:

__Associativity:__

$\forall a,b,c \in G: (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) $

__Existence of Identity Element:__

$\exists e \in G \\; \forall a \in G: e \cdot a = a$

__Existence of Inverse Element:__

$\exists i \in G \\; \forall a \in G: a \cdot i = e$

### Finite Groups

Definition: Group whose underlying set is finite.

|Term / Whatever|Definition|
|-|-|
|Order|The order of a finite Group G is the number of elements in the underlying set|
|Prime Power|Positive integer power of a single prime power|
|Cyclic Group|Groups that can be generated by a single element (e.g. the groups under modular addition|


## Field
A field  is a set $\displaystyle F$ on which two binary operations, called addition  and multipication, are defined.

A field has to satisfy the following properties, called field axioms:

__Associativity of addition and multiplication:__

$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \land (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in F$

__Commutativity of additon and multiplication:__

$a + b = b + a \land a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a,b \in F$

__Additive and multiplicative identity:__

There exist distinct elemens 0 and 1 in F such that $a + 0 = a$ and $a \cdot 1 = a$

__Additive inverse:__

For every $a$ in the set $F$, there exists an element $-a$ in F, such that $a + (-a) = 0$

__Multiplicative Inverse:__

For every $a \neq 0$ in the set $F$, there exists an element $a^{-1}$ in F, such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$

__Distributivity of multiplication over addition:__

$a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in F$

### Other field stuff / terms

__Characteristic:__

## Ring

Rings are a generalization of fields:
+ Multiplication does not need to be communtative
+ Multiplicative inverse does not need to exist

### Ring Stuff

__Characteristic:__

The characteristic of a ring $R$ is the smallest solution to the equation:

$n \cdot 1 = 0$

where $1$ is the multiplicative identity of R, $0$ is the additive identity of $R$ and
$n \in \N^+$. If there is no such n, the characteristic of $R$ is $0$.

### Rng
A structure like a ring, without assuming the existence of a multiplicative identity... "Ring without i(dentity)"
